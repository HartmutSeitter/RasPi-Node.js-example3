# Node.js Starter Overview
The Node.js Starter demonstrates a simple, reusable Node.js web application based on the Express framework.

This part 3 of the end-to-end implementation scenarion 'will put the picture to the pouchDB/cloudantDB' deployed on bluemix
before you can use this code here on a raspberry pi, you have to deploy a cloudantDB service instance in Bluemix and get the credentials which has to
be used in the app.js

Part 1 is only a Node.js skeleton to get started with Node.js on Raspberry Pi
       to get familiar with the code structure in app.js start the web server access to the web server using the browser
Part 2 will be an extension to Node.js Application to take pictures and store in the FileSystem
--------------------------
Part 3 will be an extension to upload the picture to the CloudantDB from RasPi
--------------------------

Part 4 her the stuff to handle the Alchemy API for FaceDetection will be handled

Part 5.... will cover the bluemix side applications
